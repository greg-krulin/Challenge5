# Project Title

This project uses APIs and Monte Carlo simulation to make finacial decisions for a hypothetical retirement fund.

## Description

In this challenge, we are using API tools to collect real world data to do finacial analysis for a hypothetical retirement fund. A combination of crypto, stocks, and bonds are uses for this fund.

We take the data we have collected and see if it can handle an emergancy and use basic logic conditions to report whether or not that is the case.

We then use monte carlo simulations with a wider time range of our stocks and bonds assets to calculate the potential return of a 30 year retirement plan and a 10 year retirement plan. 

The conclusion we can make is that the 10 year plan is not suffiecent to retire comfortably.
